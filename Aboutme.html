					a great dream of mine to get new friends and i am really exciting that it will become true. First, i want to 
					tell something about me and my family.
					
						My family is a typical Asian family. There are my parents, my two older brothers (they are 31 and 29 years old).
					My mother is a housewife and she is also worked at her mother restaurant. She is the most important person in my 
					life and the most powerful individual i know. She also likes to talk with other people. 
					
						My father works as a farmer and he is my hero. He is the one i look upon whenever i find myself in trouble. 
					His presence is vital for maintaining the balance and peace in my family. I have good relationship with my 
					brothers and my parents. Now, it is time to talk about myself.
					
						I am creative and ambitious young women because i have a lot of ideas about my future. I am currently study at &nbsp;&nbsp;
					<mark>UiTM Kuala Terengganu</mark>&nbsp;&nbsp; as a computer programming students and will graduate in 2021 with a degree in &nbsp;&nbsp;
					<mark>Computer Science.</mark>&nbsp;&nbsp;My ambition is to become a lecturer and my hobby is surfing Internet. Things i like the
					most is watching movie and jogging is one of the things i dislike. I really like programming because i love looking
					through code so i can find errors and fix them. It took meticulous approach and a lot of patience. 
						Thanks for spending time with me. It's been great talking with you. Love xoxo!
